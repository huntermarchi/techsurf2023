# Project's Title:

Design & Develop an impressive tool that utilizes generative AI to generate content while maintaining the style and tone of previously written content.
So we designed two applications for AI Generative .

1. AI image generator
2. AI text generator

                                        CONTENTSTACK AI IMAGE GENERATOR

  Below is the homepage of AI Image generator  üèÜüèÜ

# HOW TO MAKE THE RUNNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ABOVE APPLICATION 

                            pip install openai

To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory.

                        npm install openai@^4.0.0
 All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

                        Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY

 Example curl command:
                           curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: org-ud1aMk8vQtEmb0HbOw8Cfb7Y"


  Example with the openai Python package:

import os
import openai
openai.organization = "org-ud1aMk8vQtEmb0HbOw8Cfb7Y"
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Model.list()


 Example with the openai Node.js package:

import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
    organization: "org-ud1aMk8vQtEmb0HbOw8Cfb7Y",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.listEngines();
